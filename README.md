Here we are going to present our work, efforts and results on the 3d-printed microscope while realizing various approaches. 


MotorControl.py is used to control the stepper motors that control the stage motion. 
In it, a 3D scanning method is implemented to scan through a defined 3D region at a particular speed.

After the 3D scanning method is calibrated to the microscope, an image processing method will be needed to turn the individual points taken by the confocal sample scanning into a real image.
